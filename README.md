# Coursera-Project-3 

This repository contains my solution to the course project 3: Getting and Cleaning Data. Its contains my code along with the instructions on how the analysis had been carried out on the Human Activity dataset.

It contains the following files:

1. CodeBook.md : it describes the procedure alongwith the variables that I utilized to carry out the analysis.

2. run_analysis.R : It is the code that I utilized to perform the analysis as required by the course project. It has the 5 following steps as stated in the requirement:
-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

3. finalized.txt : It contains the result after going through all the procudure in run_analysis.R.
